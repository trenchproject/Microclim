<b>Pearson correlation coefficient</b> is the measurement of the strength of the relationship between two variables and their association with each other. It takes a value between -1 and 1, and the value further away from 0, the stronger the two variables are related.

<b>Bias</b> represents the average difference between the two datasets for each data point. The smaller the bias, the closer the data are to each other.

<b>Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)</b> is defined as the square root of the average squared error. RMSE is heavy on the largest errors. The smaller the RMSE, the closer the data are to each other.
